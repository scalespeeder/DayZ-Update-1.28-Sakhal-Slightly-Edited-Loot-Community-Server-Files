Using these modded xml files could break the functioning of your DAYZ server, requiring a reinstall that would wipe
all player progress.

Using these modded xml files neccessitates increased regular restarts to prevent server crashing.

It is suggested you thoroughly test your server after applying these files to ensure proper
functioning of your server.

cfggameplay.json includes map function config that shows player position without needing GPS Receiver, tourist map or compass, and build anywhere settings. cfggameplay.json must be enabled in server settings and / or serverdz.cfg.
DO NOT USE cfggameplay.json if you don't want build anywhere enabled.

These files have less mods than my previous ones and are also made from fresh 1.27 experimental files. No hidden or special items are added, apart from those listed below.

Many thanks to DayZ Boosterz website for their easy-to-use and fast tools! https://dayzboosterz.com/

-----------------------

PLEASE READ THE INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO INSTALL THESE FILES AS IT IS DIFFERENT TO HOW IT USED TO BE DONE!!!!!!

-----------------------

Only upload these files when update 1.28 has gone live.

Stop your server.

To install these files, firstly make sure you make backups of any custom files or settings you might also need. Then reset you server mission files to default / vanilla files.
Then (if you are going to use it) upload cfggameplay.xml OVER THE TOP OF & IN THE SAME FOLDER THE ORGINAL VERSION OF THIS FILE.

On console you already have a "custom" folder inside the mission folder on your server. ON PC YOU MUST MAKE ONE, eg: mpmissions\dayzOffline.sakhal\custom

Now upload 1S-128-extra-types.xml 1S-128-extra-events.xml 1S-128-extra-cgfspawnabletypes.xml 1S-128-extra-messages.xml & 1S-128-extra-globals.xml into that custom folder.

Next open up your vanilla cfgeconomycore.xml, and near the bottom, above the closing

</economycore>

tag,

paste this:

	<ce folder="custom">
	<file name="1S-128-extra-types.xml" type="types" />
	<file name="1S-128-extra-events.xml" type="events" />
	<file name="1S-128-extra-cfgspawnabletypes.xml" type="spawnabletypes" />
	<file name="1S-128-extra-messages.xml" type="messages" />
	<file name="1S-128-extra-globals.xml" type="globals" />
	</ce>
	
Save the file and re-upload if necessary.

Restart your server & changes should start to take effect. How quickly will depend on the population of your server.
